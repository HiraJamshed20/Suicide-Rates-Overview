# Suicide-Rates-Overview
This was implemented as part of a project of the Data Science course (CS334) in a group of 5 members. The project is divided into two notebooks:
1) Data Cleaning + Phase 1 of EDA: This notebook shows the code for cleaning the dataset, filtering the dataset and plotting trends as part of EDA
2) Phase 2 of EDA (Hypothesis testing): This notebook shows hypothesis testing being done for the generation, gender and age features.

The data-sets sourced from kaggle are also included.

My main contribution was in both of the notebooks, primarily the phase 2 notebook. A detailed walk-through of the project and the conclusions drawn is given in the following blogpost: https://medium.com/@sabarehman1998/31c56f19a3bd.
